## MAST Libraries (written in NQP)

MAST stands for Moar Abstract Syntax Tree, and is akin to the other NQP
backends' VM-specific AST systems (PIRT for Parrot VM and JAST for JVM).

Nodes.nqp contains the NQP classes that define the AST nodes, which map closely
to the various components of MoarVM's bytecode format.

Ops.nqp is generated by tools/update_ops.p6 from src/core/oplist.  For the
bootstrap, it is concatenated with the other MAST-related NQP files to be
compiled to a single .moarvm bytecode library.
