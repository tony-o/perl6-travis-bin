Makefile targets:

        help    display this message

         all    build library and MoarVM executable [default]
         lib    build library only

        test    dummy target
                ( use the nqp-cc test suite instead )

      switch    rebuild executable with switch dispatch [default]
     tracing    rebuild executable with tracing dispatch
       cgoto    rebuild executable with computed goto dispatch

  no-tracing    alias for switch
    no-cgoto    alias for switch

       clean    remove build files
   realclean    additionally remove auxiliary and 3rdparty files
                ( needs to be called when switching between
                  shared and static library builds )
   distclean    additionally remove executable, library and
                configuration files
                ( should remove all generated files )

    reconfig    calls Configure.pl after doing a realclean
                ( use CONFIG and ADDCONFIG to control options )

Makefile options:

     NOISY=1    show actual commands instead of descriptions

    CONFIG=?    passed to Configure.pl by reconfig

 ADDCONFIG=?    passed to Configure.pl by reconfig in addition
                to the previously passed arguments
