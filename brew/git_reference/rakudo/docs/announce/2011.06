    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #42 ("Bruxelles")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
June 2011 release of Rakudo Perl #42 "Bruxelles".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the June 2011 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The June 2011 release is code named
"Bruxelles".

DON'T PANIC:  Browsing the change log below, it might appear
as though not much Rakudo development is taking place.  Nearly
all of the development activity is now occurring in the "nom" 
branch of the Rakudo repository (over 500 commits since the 2011.05
release).  This new branch will shortly become the mainline branch
from which monthly releases are made, and already contains many
important bugfixes and performance improvements.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring in the
master branch with this release include:

* Fixed a bug with &infix:<=> when used in multiple assignments to
  aggregate elements.
* Improved parrot register handling for more efficient code.
* Added take-rw and return-rw functions.

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Patrick R. Michaud, Moritz Lenz, Martin Berends, Tadeusz So≈õnierz,
JD Horelick, and others.

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#43) is scheduled for July 21, 2011.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2011 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun and don't forget your towel!
