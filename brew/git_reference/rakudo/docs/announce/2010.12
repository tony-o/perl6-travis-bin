    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #36 ("New York")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
December 2010 release of Rakudo Perl #36 "New York".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the December 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The December 2010 release is code named
"New York" the first PM group, created by brian d foy, in tribute to Perl's
23rd anniversary, which was celebrated on the 18th of this month.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* new .trans algorithm

* configuration improvements

* several bug fixes

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Moritz Lenz, Carl Masak, Solomon Foster, Kodi Arfer, Fernando Brito,
Tomoki Aonuma, Nick Wellnhofer, Patrick R. Michaud, Abi Salloum, frettled,
smashz and Jonathan Scott Duff.

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#37) is scheduled for January 20, 2011.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2011 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
