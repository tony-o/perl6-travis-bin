    # There are three kinds of worker:

    # * Timer worker threads are intended to handle time-based events. They
    #   pull events from the time-sensitive queue, and they will not do any
    #   work stealing so as to be ready and available for timer events. The
    #   time-sensitive queue will only be returned when a queue is requested
    #   with the :hint-time-sensitive named argument. Only one timer worker
    #   will be created on the first request for such a queue; the supervisor
    #   will then monitor the time-sensitive queue length and add more if
    #   needed.
    # * Affinity worker threads each have their own queue. They are used when
    #   a queue is requested and :hint-affinity is passed. These are useful
    #   for things like Proc::Async and IO::Socket::Async, where events will
    #   be processed using a Supply, which is serial, and so there's no point
    #   at all in contending over the data. Work will not be stolen from an
