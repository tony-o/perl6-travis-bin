=head1 Bootstrapping procedure for nqp-rx

NPQ-rx is a bootstrapped compiler, which means that it uses itself to compile
itself.

To make the first compilation possible, a compiled version of the compiler is
stored in F</src/stage0/*.pir> and included in the source code repository.
Also the parrot virtual machine ships the same
C<stage0/*.pir> files.

When you make changes to the compiler, eventually you need to update these
I<stage0> files.

Here is how you proceed to update the bootstrapping files nqp-rx and parrot.
At any stage, if C<make test> fails, don't go ahead with the following steps,
but fix the problem first.
