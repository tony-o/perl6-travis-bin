=head1 Bootstrapping procedure for NQP

NPQ is a bootstrapped compiler, which means that it uses itself to compile
itself.

To make the first compilation possible under MoarVM, a compiled version of the
compiler is stored in F<src/vm/moar/stage0/*.moarvm> and included in the source
code repository.

When you make changes to the compiler, eventually you need to update these
I<stage0> files.

Here is how you proceed to update the MoarVM bootstrapping files in NQP.  At
any stage, if C<make test> fails, don't go ahead with the following steps, but
fix the problem first.

(Note: the equivalent under JVM is F<src/vm/jvm/stage0/*.jar> with the update 
target C<make j-bootstrap-files>)
