# While the grammar represents the syntactic elements of our language and
# the actions take care of building up an AST to represent the semantics
# of it, the world is about the declarative aspects of a language. This
# includes:
#
# * Symbol table management
# * Creating meta-object instances
# * Parts of library loading (most likely it delegates to an actual loader)
# * Resolving references to objects, within or between compilation units
#
# Just as there is one AST produced per compilation unit, there is also a
# world produce per compilation unit.
#
# A world includes a serialization context. This contains a bunch of
# objects - often meta-objects - that we want to persist across the
# compile time / run time boundary. If we're doing pre-compilation
# rather than "immediate run" then we serialize the contents of the
# serialization context.
