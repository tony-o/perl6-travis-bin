    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #35 ("Melbourne")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
November 2010 release of Rakudo Perl #35 "Melbourne".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the November 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The November 2010 release is code named
"Melbourne", PM group of Damian Conway, long-time advocate/explicator of
and contributor to Perl 6.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* qw// is now implemented

* .trans is now 5 times faster

* indexing is now possible with both ranges and Whatever
  offsets together: @a[0 .. *-2]

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Moritz Lenz, Solomon Foster, Kodi Arfer, Tadeusz Sośnierz, Nick Wellnhofer,
Jonathan Scott Duff, Bruce Gray, Jonathan Worthington, Patrick R.  Michaud,
mikehh, flussence, Jan Ingvoldstad, and your humble release manager Carl
Mäsak.

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#36) is scheduled for December 23, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
