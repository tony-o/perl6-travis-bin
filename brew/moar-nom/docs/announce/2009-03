Announce: Rakudo Perl development release #15 ("Oslo") 

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce
the March 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #15 "Oslo".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine [1].
The tarball for the March 2009 release is available from

    http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-03.tar.gz

However, because of the rapid pace of Rakudo development and addition
of new features, we still recommend that people wanting to use or work
with Rakudo obtain the latest version directly from the main repository
at github -- more on this in a bit.

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named 
after a Perl Mongers group.  This release is named "Oslo" in honor of 
the organizers of the 2009 Nordic Perl Workshop [2], April 16-17, 2009.  
The 2009 Nordic Perl Workshop will have a special focus on Perl 6, 
Rakudo Perl, and Parrot, including Perl 6 tutorials and hackathons 
after the conference itself.

A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is 
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo 
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each 
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Rakudo Perl now uses git [3] for its version control system, hosted 
at http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo .  The README file there is kept 
up-to-date with the latest instructions for obtaining and building 
Rakudo Perl.

In this release of Rakudo Perl, we've made the following major changes
and improvements:

* Rakudo is now passing 7273 spectests.  This is an increase of 197 
  passing tests since the February 2009 release.

* The eval() construct now understands lexical variables from an
  outer scope.

* More of the builtin functions ("settings") are being written in Perl 6.

* Rakudo supports the "R" (reverse) metaoperator.

* Parsing of if, unless, while, until, etc. statements after blocks
  now works correctly.

* The Q quote operator is now implemented, along with several adverbial
  forms.  In particular, the Q:PIR form allows inline PIR to be
  included in Perl 6 code.

* Multi-method dispatch now works with inheritance also.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  The next release of Rakudo (#16) is
scheduled for April 23, 2009.
