    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #39 ("Orlando")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
March 2011 release of Rakudo Perl #39 "Orlando".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the March 2011 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The March 2011 release is code named
"Orlando".

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* an improved error message on type check failure in assignment
* -n and -p command line options
* complex conjugation support implemented

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Moritz Lenz, Tadeusz Sośnierz, Carl Masak, Arne Skjærholt, William Orr, 
Kyle Hasselbacher, Jonathan Scott Duff, Dave Whipp, Jonathan Worthington,
martin, Solomon Foster, JD Horelick, Jimmy Zhuo, Martin Berends, 
Patrick Abi Salloum, JimmyZ

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#40) is scheduled for April 21, 2011.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2011 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
