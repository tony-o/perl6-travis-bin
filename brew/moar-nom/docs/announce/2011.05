    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #41 ("Dahut")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
May 2011 release of Rakudo Perl #41 "Dahut".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the May 2011 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The May 2011 release is code named
"Dahut".

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* added a call counter for builtins in Perl 6-level subroutines
* gcd (greatest common divisor) and lcm (largest common multiple) operators
* implemented Int.base

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Patrick R. Michaud, Moritz Lenz, Jonathan Scott Duff, Tadeusz So≈õnierz, 
Carl Masak, Solomon Foster, bacek

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#42) is scheduled for June 23, 2011.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2011 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
