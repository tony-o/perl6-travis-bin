    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #29 ("Erlangen")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the
May 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #29 "Erlangen".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see http://www.parrot.org).  The tarball for the May 2010 release
is available from http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads .

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release named
after a Perl Mongers group.  The May 2010 release is code named
"Erlangen" in recognition of Erlangen.pm and the Perl 6 talk that Moritz
Lenz, one of our core developers, gave this month.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* Lexical classes and roles were implemented. Additionally, anonymous classes
  -- which were never quite right in alpha -- are now implemented more
  correctly, and anonymous roles are also supported.

* Basic support for named enumerations of the form 'enum Weekday <Monday
  Tuesday ...>' has been restored.

* First cut of use Foo:from<perl5> and eval('foo', :lang<perl5>); needs
  Blizkost[1] to be installed to work.

*  Numeric / Real roles much closer to the spec now.

*  As always, many additional small features and bug fixes make working with
   Rakudo more pleasant.

*  Rakudo now passes 32,347 spectests. We estimate that there are about
   39,500 tests in the test suite, so Rakudo passes about 82% of all tests.

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on parrot, the
Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:
Solomon Foster, Moritz Lenz, Jonathan Worthington, Martin Berends,
chromatic, Carl Masak, snarkyboojum, Stefan O'Rear, Reini Urban,
Jonathan Scott Duff, takadonet, Christoph Otto, isBEKaml,
ash_, bubaflub, Jimmy Zhuo, Peter Lobsinger and Patrick Abi Salloum

If you would like to contribute,
see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#30) is scheduled for June 17, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
