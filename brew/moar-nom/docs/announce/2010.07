    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #31 ("Atlanta")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
July 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #31 "Atlanta".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see <http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the July 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This is not the Rakudo Star release, which is scheduled
for July 29, 2010 [1]. The Star release will include the compiler, an
installer, modules, a book (PDF), and more.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The July 2010 release is code named
"Atlanta" in recognition of Atlanta.pm and their Perl 5 Phalanx project [2],
which they selected for its benefits to Perl 6.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* Rakudo now properly constructs closures in most instances.

* Undefined objects can now autovivify into arrays or hashes when
  subscripted with .[ ] or .{ } .

* Arrays can now handle infinite ranges.

* Generic, multi-level Whatever-currying now works, e.g. (1, 1, *+* ... *).

* The REPL shell now remembers lexical declarations in susbsequent lines.

* The open() subroutine now returns a Failure instead of throwing
  a fatal exception.

* Rakudo now provides $*ARGFILES for reading from files specified
  on the command line.

* Added $*PERL, moved %*VM to $*VM.

* Simple binding operators := and ::= now work.

* Simple feed operators <== and ==> now work.

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on parrot, the
Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The next release of Rakudo (#32) is scheduled for August 19, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
