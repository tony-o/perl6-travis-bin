    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #34 ("Paris")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
October 2010 release of Rakudo Perl #34 "Paris".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the October 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The October 2010 release is code named
"Paris", because the of the Perl love at the Open Source Developers Conference 
held in Paris, France earlier in the month.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* we now have a simple version of require

* the local timezone is available in $*TZ

* samespace versions of m// and s/// were implemented as ms// and ss/// respectively.

* Str.flip is now 100 times faster than it used to be

* the subroutine version of Str.comb now exists

* Hyperoperators can now be applied to infix:<+=> and friends.

* improved diagnostic messages

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Moritz Lenz, Kodi Arfer, Patrick R. Michaud, Bruce Gray, 
Carl Masak, Ronald Schmidt, Jonathan Worthington, TimToady, 
TimTom, PhatEddy, Patrick Abi Salloum, and your humble release
manager Jonathan Scott Duff.

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#35) is scheduled for November 18, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
