    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #57 ("Tokyo")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm thrilled to announce the
October 2012 release of Rakudo Perl #57 "Tokyo". Rakudo is an
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for this release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[*] -- it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.
For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each
release named after a Perl Mongers group. The October 2012 release is
code-named after Tokyo.pm, hosts of YAPC::Asia 2012.

This release brings changes; some of them are outlined below:

- delegation to methods using the handles trait
- improved handling of :P5 regexes
- reduced memory usage for Match objects
- each REPL line no longer implies a fresh GLOBAL
- import of custom meta-objects only affects the scope they are imported into
- can now parse nested pairs of quote delimeters, like q{ foo q{ bar } baz }

This is only a small peek at the changes in this release. For a more
detailed list, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Jonathan Worthington, Moritz Lenz, Patrick R. Michaud, Solomon Foster,
diakopter, Timothy Totten

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>,
ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6
on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#58) is scheduled for November 22, 2012. A
list of the other planned release dates and code names for future
releases is available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file. In general,
Rakudo development releases are scheduled to occur soon after each Parrot
monthly release. Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

On behalf of the development team, I encourage you to try the new release,
to live life to its fullest, to cherish each moment, and to have fun.

[*] What's the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
    Star distribution?

    The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl 6 language.
    Nothing else.

    The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
    of useful Perl 6 modules, the most recent incarnation of the "Using
    Perl 6" book, and other software that can be used with the Rakudo
    compiler to enhance its utility.  Rakudo Star is meant for early
    adopters who wish to explore what's possible with Rakudo Perl 6 and
    provide feedback on what works, what doesn't, and what else they
    would like to see included in the distribution.
