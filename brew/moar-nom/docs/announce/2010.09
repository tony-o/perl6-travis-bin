    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #33 ("Milan")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
August 2010 release of Rakudo Perl #33 "Milan".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the September 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The September 2010 release is code named
"Milan", because the release manager happens to like the name :-)

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* The specification for temporal objects (DateTime, Date, Instant and
  Duration) is now completely implemented in Rakudo

* Several performance improvements were implemented, most notably in
  slurp() and reverse() functions

* The series operator has been refactored, and updated to the current
  specification

* Enumeration objects now conform much closer to the current specification

* 'now' and 'time' are now terms (and not functions anymore). This means you
  can now write 'time - 1' and do what you mean, but 'time()' does not work
  anymore

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".


Deprecation notice:

* Currently True and False evaluate as '1' and '0' in string context.
  The specification has changed, and in the next release they will
  evaluate to 'Bool::True' and 'Bool::False' in string context.
  To get the old behaviour, use ~+True or ~+False.


The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Moritz Lenz, Patrick R. Michaud, Carl Masak, Patrick Abi Salloum,
Solomon Foster, Kodi Arfer, chromatic, Kyle Hasselbacher, Bruce Gray,

the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#34) is scheduled for October 21, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
