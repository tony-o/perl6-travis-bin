    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #40 ("ZA")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
April 2011 release of Rakudo Perl #40 "ZA".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the April 2011 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each
release named after a Perl Mongers group.  The April 2011 release is
code named "ZA" after ZA.pm in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South
Africa because the denizens of #perl6 have an unusual facination with
zebras and ZA just happens to have a "Z" and, according to my meager 
research, there are indeed zebras in the area.  :-)

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* implemented Str.indent
* A new, much simpler API and implemention of IO::Socket::INET

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Moritz Lenz, Tadeusz So≈õnierz, Martin Berends, Andy Lester, 
Jonathan Scott Duff, flussence, Patrick Abi Salloum, Carl Masak, 
Jarrod

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#41) is scheduled for May 19, 2011.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2011 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
